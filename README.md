# Vagrant-lamp-cluster
Deployment of Vagrant Ubuntu Cluster with LAMP Stack.

The project automates the deployment and configuration of a two-node Ubuntu cluster, where the Master node acts as a control system, and the Slave node is managed by the Master. It ensures user management, SSH key-based authentication, data transfer, process monitoring, and LAMP stack installation on both nodes.
